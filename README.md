# Lista ir agora

This test aims to evaluate the candidate's skills in Flutter, Dart, state management, API consumption, and unit testing. The challenge involves developing the motel listing screen (specifically the "Ir Agora" tab) from the Guia de Motéis GO app, using mock APIs to retrieve data.

The listing should display motel name, price, and image, allowing for visual variations without requiring strict adherence to the original design. Additionally, unit tests must be implemented to cover the main components of the application.
